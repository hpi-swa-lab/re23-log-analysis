ERROR: Cannot install numpy, numpy==1.21.3, numpy==1.21.5 and numpy>=1.16.6 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.21.5
    The user requested numpy
    The user requested numpy>=1.16.6
    The user requested numpy==1.21.3

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
